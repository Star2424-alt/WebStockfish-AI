# Chess

Chess is a lightweight web-based chess game that allows players to play against the Stockfish chess engine through a public API.  
The project is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without frameworks or build tools.

It focuses on simplicity, clarity, and smooth gameplay in the browser.
